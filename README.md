# Heung Min Son's Evolution through Data

## Analysis of South Korean professional foobtball player Heung Min Son since the start of his career using Machine Learning and Data Visualization

>### Context
Heung Min Son is nowadays one of the most prolific football player in the world. His performances with Tottenham and South Korea's national team keep getting better through the seasons and that is what we are interested in.

Since his debut at Hamburg, then at Leverkusen and then finally at Spurs, Son has kept improving his skills and has become one of the best strikers in the Premier League and one of the best Asian players in history. 

>### Objective

With this project, we are trying to understand on which points Son improved to get to this level and see if we can explain this thanks to different data. 
To do so, we will be using various Machine Learning algorithms and Data Visualization to present the results of this study.
